# My point of view on SSR

I will be direct: from my point of view, SSR is a hype instead of a real evolution. You may disagree, but before you leave this article, let me explain why:

### SSR is nothing new

In the 2000s the whole web was SSR: php was the dominent language to create webpages.
You had to code your entire website or application in php to bring interactivity.
Everything was generated on the server and sent to the user.

So SRR, is nothing new, as it almost exists since... the beginning of the web.


The hype probably comes from 2 points:

- we have more and more developers as computing is a game changer in this 21 century.
  This means that young developers probably didn't work with "old" technologies like php to create webpages.
  Instead, they jumped-in directly into frameworks like Angular or React, and experimenting with SSR is probably a fun thing to try.
  This creates a hype, but not a revolution.
- SSR is great for SEO...but is it really ? https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics#0 [https://www.mazeless.com/blog/can-google-crawl-spa-and-other-challenges-of-single-page-apps/]
