# Introduction

🎨 **@lirx/dom** is an **application design framework** for the Web.
It has been created to build **very large and robust** web applications, with unbeatable performances.
It's main goal, it to create the **perfect SPA**.

🧩 You can create and assemble **millions of components** easily.
It closely follows the [MVC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) pattern, with a strict separation between HTML, CSS, and JS files.
Each component is independent. Meaning: easier dependencies' management, reusable components across applications and single imports.

🚝 It is based purely on **[Observables](https://core.lirx.org/)**.
So you can compose very complex pipelines in just a few lines of code.
The framework will take care to refresh only the relevant Nodes, as fast as if it was done natively.

🦸 This is your **best ally** when developing a **web-app**.
Code in a more predictable way with clear data workflows, avoiding bugs, errors and inconsistent states.

`@lirx/dom` gives you many tools to **write and build dynamic html templates** and **components** with an elegant syntax.
Due to its unique architecture based purely on Observables, it strongly outperforms Angular, as well as JSX based frameworks (like React).

Moreover, it comes with an [AOT plugin for rollup](https://github.com/lirx-js/dom-aot-plugin),
a must-have, optimizing the components to generate small bundles, and fast applications.

> It's light, fast, and simple ! Give it a try !

### A quick look at what your components will look like:

import Example from './_example.mdx';

<Example/>

As you may notice, **this framework has similarities with Angular**.
This is done on purpose, as we want to attract developers, without the necessity to learn a completely new language.
So, if you're already an Angular developer, you may be interested: this framework brings incredible performances, with a template and style close to Angular.

### Purpose of this framework

`@lirx/dom` tries to conciliate the best ideas, coming from different web frameworks, to create the fastest and lightest one.

To achieve its goals, it compiles the HTML templates into native javascript with direct DOM manipulation.
This way, it doesn't have to use an internal *differ* algorithm on the properties of the components (Angular),
nor iterates over a Virtual DOM and compare the resulting objects (JSX frameworks).

With `@lirx/dom`, and due to its Observable based nature, **only the absolutely essential and minimal javascript is executed**;
with just the relevant nodes refreshed and nothing else. Thus, the DOM is updated with the precision of a surgeon,
and the same performances as if it was written natively.

> 🤨 Another framework for web-apps ? Isn't it redundant ?

You're partially right.

`@lirx/dom` is done for perfectionists: using Observables **constraint you to work with Reactive Programming**,
which is a totally different manner of thinking your code.
It's usually complex and discouraging for beginners.
But coding in RP garanties robust and fast applications.
Observables are very impressive and bring **incredible possibilities**, they just require time to be adopted.

Another keypoint of `@lirx/dom` is its performances as seen earlier.
The most popular frameworks are very intuitive, but this simplicity has a cost in execution time and bundle size.
This cost is usually ignored because our machines are fast enough for most cases.
And let's be honest: developers are lazy and/or constrained with deadlines.
Non optimized code is common and frequent.

So:

> If you don't really care about performances or proper software architecture, you're not the target of this framework.

However, if you care, and want to build robust applications, it may be worth experimenting with it.
