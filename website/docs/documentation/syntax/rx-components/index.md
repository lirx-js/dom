# RX Components


**RX Components** are a category of elements having tag names starting with `rx-`.
They are compiled into optimized javascript, with special behaviour.

The syntax looks like this:

```html
<rx-if
  ...attributes
>
  ...content
</rx-if>
```

Usually, they are used to create or manipulate many Elements in the DOM.
